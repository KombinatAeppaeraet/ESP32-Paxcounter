// In LoRaWAN, a gateway applies I/Q inversion on TX, and nodes do the
// same on RX. This ensures that gateways can talk to nodes and vice
// versa, but gateways will not hear other gateways and nodes will not
// hear other nodes. By uncommenting this macro, this inversion is
// disabled and this node can hear other nodes. If two nodes both have
// this macro set, they can talk to each other (but they can no longer
// hear gateways). This should probably only be used when debugging
// and/or when talking to the radio directly (e.g. like in the "raw"
// example).
